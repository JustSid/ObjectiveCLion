# ObjectiveCLion

A plugin that forces CLion to treat C and C++ files as Objective-C and Objective-C++ files respectively. Why? Because I can
and because CLion is based on AppCode and ships with enough to "just" enable the ObjC(++) support again.

However, this is really more of a proof of concept of this working in general. It got a couple of issues and I have only tested
it on OS X (for obvious reasons), although CLion won't prevent you from loading this on Window or Linux and I have no idea
what will happen there.
